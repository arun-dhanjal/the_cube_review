## Purpose and Value

### Application Purpose
 
This application is designed to give a specific group of users (twisty puzzle enthusiasts) a platform on which they can interact as a community in a number of ways. The main use cases would be: a feed section for viewing, submitting, and commenting on posts; a reviews section to read and submit reviews on a number of puzzles; and a leaderboards section to see solve-time rankings and even add your own. The application would be used in a similar way to other social media apps, albeit on a smaller scale and in a much more specific way.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![The Cube Review Colour Palette](/readme-docs/the-cube-review-palette.png)

A palette of mainly differing shades of red was chosen for the theme of this application. The intention was to keep things looking relatively minimalistic with splashes of a key colour throughout. The majority of buttons use these shades of red with white text. Edit and delete icons are grey whilst inactive, turning red on hover, fitting the minimalistic style. Navigation icons are bold in black, but also turn red on hover or when active.

One key exception to the overarching colour scheme applies to content that is pending approval. Posts, comments, and reviews that are yet to be approved will be highlighted in a pale, muted yellow with 'Pending approval' text written in a shade of blue. This combination has been chosen to make it clear when content is pending approval whilst remaining easy on the eye, and most importantly retaining stark contrast for accessibility.

The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Although other fonts could have been implemented, the default fonts work very well with the design of the site and so no other fonts have been selected. However, other fonts could be used in future iterations, in which case Google Fonts will be utilised for this purpose.

### Page Layout

Wireframes were created based on the initial page layout designs for various screen sizes. The final deployed application has some minor stylistic changes/additions, but for the most part follows the same general design. Wireframes shown below:

#### Wireframe Mobile
![Wireframe Mobile](/readme-docs/wireframe-mobile.png)
#### Wireframe Tablet
![Wireframe Tablet](/readme-docs/wireframe-tablet.png)
#### Wireframe Desktop
![Wireframe Desktop](/readme-docs/wireframe-desktop.png)

### Database Structure

The back-end databases were designed at the start of the project with the intention of remaining unchanged throughout the development in order to avoid later complications. The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) can be viewed below:

![< ERD >](/readme-docs/erd.png)

### Features

#### Site header

  ![< Site header logged out >](/readme-docs/feature-site-header-logged-out.png)

  ![< Site header logged in >](/readme-docs/feature-site-header-logged-in.png)

  * Black when inactive, but red on hover

  * Red when active, including underline to make current page status clear

  * Navigation icons are at the top of every page, however they are not sticky like the site header, as this will take up too much of the viewport

#### Feedback messages

  ![ Feedback messages ](/readme-docs/feature-feedback-messages.png)

  * Feedback messages appear at the top of the page (below the navigation icons) to provide the user with feedback following actions they have taken

  * Actions include things such as: changing authentication status; creating content; updating content; deleting content; making a request that cannot be actioned

#### Feed page

#### Leaderboards page

  ![< Leaderboards page >](/readme-docs/feature-leaderboards-page.png)

  * Clicking the trophy icon in the icon navigation section will redirect you to the Leaderboards page

  * This functions similarly to the Feed and Puzzle List pages in that you will see a paginated list of cards, however instead of posts or reviews it will be solve-time leaderboards

  * A leaderboard will be available for every puzzle that featured on the Puzzle List page

  * Each leaderboard will consist of the following: the puzzle name; a table of all submitted solve-times for that puzzle

  * The table will consist of: rank; username; time (in hours, minutes, and seconds); and date of submission

  * Entries will be ordered according to the fastest times i.e. the fastest time will be at the top of the list, ranked #1

  * If a user is logged in and has submitted a time, their time will be highlighted in bold text

  * In addition, the user will be able to update or delete their time submission

  * Note that submissions and updates work different here: only one submission can be made per user per puzzle, and so users will not be able to submit a new time for a puzzle they have already submitted to - they must update that leaderboard

#### Submit Time form

  ![< Submit Time form >](/readme-docs/feature-submit-time-form.png)

  * Clicking the Submit Time button redirects you to a page featuring the Submit Time form

  * This form includes the following fields: puzzle (a dropdown including all puzzles from the Puzzle List page); hours; minutes; seconds

  * The time fields have validation applied and will not allow for invalid times to be submitted

  * After filling out the form correctly, clicking the Submit button will redirect you to the Leaderboards page, where your time will now be included in the relevant leaderboard

#### Update Time form

  ![< Update Time form >](/readme-docs/feature-update-time-form.png)

  * Clicking the Update Time button redirects you to a page featuring the Update Time form

  * This form includes the same fields as the Submit Time form, however the fields will be prepopulated with the current solve-time data

  After updating the form and clicking the Save button, you will be redirected to the Leaderboards page with the new entry now featuring in the relevant leaderboard

#### Delete Time modal

  ![< Delete Time modal >](/readme-docs/feature-delete-time-modal.png)

  * Clicking the Delete Time button on a leaderboard will bring up a modal to confirm your action

  * The modal has options to cancel by clicking the X icon or the cancel button

  * Clicking the Delete button will confirm the action, delete the time submission from the database, and redirect the user the Leaderboards page where the time submission will no longer feature on the leaderboard

#### Site footer

  ![ Site footer ](/readme-docs/feature-site-footer.png)

  * Site footer that features at the bottom of every page in the site

  * Contains minimal information about the application

  * Retains same colour scheme as the site header for thematic consistency

#### Future implementations:

Although all must-have, should-have, and could-have user stories were fulfilled for this project, additional features could add value to this site. Some examples of which are:

  * User profile section: an area for users to manage their content in one place and manage their username and password

  * Profile images on submitted content: a small profile icon would be useful to include next to posts, comments, reviews, and time submissions to give each user more of an identity in the community

  * Comment count on posts: it would be useful to have an indication of how many comments are on a post before viewing the detail page

  * Likes/reactions on content: more interaction between users could be facilitated by adding options to add likes or reactions to posts, comments, and reviews

### Accessibility

Mindful development has been exercised throughout the project to ensure the application is as accessible and user-friendly as possible. This includes:

* Using semantic HTML.

* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

* Ensuring that navigation is intuitive and easy.

* Ensuring interactive elements and inputs are easy to recognise and use.

* Including appropriate aria labelling and alt tags.

A couple of noteworthy changes that were made in response to accessibility checks:

* The chosen colour scheme of shades of red with white text on the buttons, although still persisting, initially caused some issues with contrast. The original red colour for buttons was just short of the contrast criteria (4.5) and so a slight adjustment had to be made. Luckily, the adjustment had very little impact on the design and theme, however, the contrast issue has now been addressed, allowing a wide base of users to be able to access the site.

* Similarly, the design of pending content caused some contrast issues. Initially a case of greying out the text and adding a very light red Pending approval text tag, this combination of colours did not pass contrast checks and so other options had to be considered. The intention was to keep things in line with the theme, but also ensure that it was very obvious when something was pending approval. After some experimentation, the final light yellow background and blue pending text was settled on, as this ensures a pass on contrast checks, and is a clear indicator of the status of the content.

### Device Responsivity Testing

Responsivity tests were carried out to ensure that the application displayed correctly on a number of different device sizes. For completeness, all of the default device sizes in Google Chrome's Developer Tools were tested for responsiveness by emulating each device and then navigating through the site to note any layout or formatting issues. Almost all devices returned zero issues with two exceptions, detailed below:

- Microsoft Lumia 550: Dev Tools defaults to a landscape view for this device, which makes the viewport height very short, leading to a sub-optimal user experience. However, the application is not intended to be used in landscape mode on mobile devices, and in fact the default landscape view for this device in Dev Tools is a known error, with the expected view being portrait as is the case with most mobile devices. As such, this case is of no concern for this application.

- JioPhone 2: The viewport for this device is very small at just 240 x 320 px (it is defined as a "compact device") which causes issues with layout. However, this application is not intended to be used on such small devices, and so is of no concern for this application.

## Validation

Various validation software were used to validate and/or lint the code in each of the files written for this project, with any raised errors being fixed before closing off the project. The screenshots below show evidence of this:

## AI Usage
AI has been used extensively throughout this project, with the main assistant of choice being Microsoft Copilot, however OpenAI's ChatGPT has also been used on occassion. Listed below are the ways AI has specifically been used during this project:

* Troubleshooting Django logic in Python files

* Refining template logic in HTML files

* Generating dummy usernames for site users

* Generating some site content (e.g. puzzle descriptions)

* Converting Excel files into markdown format (e.g. for the markdown table featured in the Testing section of this README)

* Scanning code files for formatting and PEP8 issues to expedite the code-tidying process

* General sounding board (e.g. asking if certain implementations or functionalities would be a good idea before committing to them)

Please note: although AI has been utilised during the development of this app, any and all AI outputs have been scrutinised and considered carefully before being implemented. The developer appreciates that AI is a tool to be used and not relied on without complete understanding of the output.

## Credits
### Content

The majority of site content has been produced from scratch by the sole developer, Arun Dhanjal. Specifically:

- Site logo: created manually in PowerPoint using shapes and shape transformations
- Site title: created manually in PowerPoint
- Puzzle List images: photographs taken of developer's own puzzles
- Post, comment, and review text and images: created manually by the developer

Some exceptions where AI was utilised to generate content:

- Puzzle descriptions: generated by Copilot
- Usernames: generated by ChatGPT
